Creation of Tabs in the Library Management System
Tabs in Salesforce provide a way to access different objects and their records quickly. In the Library Management System, we will create tabs for each of the custom objects defined earlier: Patron, Book/Catalog, Borrowing/Return, and Fine. This allows users to navigate easily through the different functionalities of the system.

Steps to Create Tabs for Custom Objects
Navigate to Setup

Click on the gear icon  in the top-right corner of the Salesforce interface to open the Setup menu.
Access Tabs Settings

In the Quick Find box on the left, type Tabs and select Tabs from the results.
Create a New Tab

Click on the New button in the Custom Object Tabs section.
Select the Custom Object

Choose one of the custom objects you want to create a tab for. For instance, select Patron from the dropdown list.
Configure Tab Settings

Tab Label: This will be the name displayed on the tab. Enter Patron.
Tab Name: This is auto-generated based on the label. It should be something like Patron.
Tab Style: Choose a color and icon that visually represent the object. You might select a suitable icon for library patrons.
Save the Tab

Click on the Next button and review your settings.
Finally, click Save to create the tab.
