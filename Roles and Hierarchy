Creation of Roles and Hierarchy in Library Management System
Roles in Salesforce are used to define the level of access users have to data within the organization. In the Library Management System, we will create three distinct roles: Library Admin, Library Staff, and Patron. Each role will reflect the hierarchy of responsibilities and permissions within the library system.

1. Library Admin Role
The Library Admin role is at the top of the hierarchy and has access to all functionalities, allowing for effective management of library operations.
