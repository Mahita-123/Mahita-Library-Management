Creation of Profiles in Library Management System
Profiles in Salesforce define a user's permissions, access levels, and settings for different objects. In the context of the Library Management System, we will create three distinct profiles: Library Admin, Library Staff, and Patron. Each profile will have different access levels to ensure that users can only perform actions relevant to their roles.

1. Library Admin Profile
The Library Admin profile will have full access to all objects and fields, allowing them to manage the library system effectively.

Steps to Create the Library Admin Profile:
Navigate to Setup:
Click on the gear icon in the top-right corner and select Setup.

Access Profiles:
In the Quick Find box, type Profiles and click on Profiles under Users.

Clone a Standard Profile:
Click on the Clone button next to an existing profile (e.g., System Administrator).
Profile Name: Library Admin
Description: "Full access to all library management functionalities."
Click Save.

Set Object Permissions:
Under the Object Settings, ensure all objects (Patron, Book/Catalog, Borrowing/Return, Fine) are set to Read, Create, Edit, and Delete.

Set Field Permissions:
Review field-level security for each object to ensure all fields are accessible.

Assign Users:
Assign users to the Library Admin profile as needed.

2. Library Staff Profile
The Library Staff profile will have permissions to manage library transactions, such as borrowing and returning books, but will not have administrative access.
