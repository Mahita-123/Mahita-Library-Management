Creation of Flows for Library Management System
1. Flow for Book Availability Status
Objective: The Book Availability Status flow automatically updates the availability of books in the Library Management System based on the borrowing and return transactions.

Steps to Create the Flow:
Navigate to Flows:

Go to Setup (gear icon) > Process Automation > Flows.
Create New Flow:

Click on New Flow and select Record-Triggered Flow.
Select Object:

Choose Borrowing/Return as the object that will trigger the flow.
Set Trigger Criteria:

Configure the flow to trigger after a record is created or updated. This will allow the flow to check the availability status whenever a borrowing or return action occurs.
Add Decision Element:

Insert a Decision element to determine the action based on the status of the Return Date.
Conditions:
If Return Date is not null and Actual Return Date is null: Change the book status to Not Available.
If Actual Return Date is not null: Change the book status back to Available.
Update Records:

Add an Update Records element to change the Availability field on the Book/Catalog object based on the decision outcomes.
Save and Activate:

Name the flow (e.g., "Book Availability Status Flow"), save it, and then activate it.
Example Usage:
When a user borrows a book, the flow checks if there is a Return Date and updates the book status to Not Available. When the book is returned, it updates the status back to Available.

2. Flow for Due Date Reminder
Objective: The Due Date Reminder flow automatically sends email notifications to patrons when their borrowed items are due soon.

Steps to Create the Flow:
Navigate to Flows:

Go to Setup (gear icon) > Process Automation > Flows.
Create New Flow:

Click on New Flow and select Scheduled-Triggered Flow.
Set Flow Schedule:

Choose to run the flow daily at a convenient time (e.g., 8:00 AM).
Add Get Records Element:

Add a Get Records element to fetch records from the Borrowing/Return object where the Return Date is within the next few days (e.g., 3 days from today).
Add Loop Element:

Insert a Loop element to iterate through each of the records retrieved in the previous step.
Send Email Action:

Inside the loop, add an Action element to Send Email.
Configure the email settings:
Recipient: Use the Patronâ€™s Email field.
Email Template: Select a pre-defined template for due date reminders that includes personalized messages.
Close the Loop:

Ensure the loop processes each borrowing record and sends an email reminder accordingly.
Save and Activate:

Name the flow (e.g., "Due Date Reminder Flow"), save it, and activate it.
Example Usage:
Every day at 8:00 AM, the flow checks for items that are due in the next three days and sends out email reminders to the respective patrons.
