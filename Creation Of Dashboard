Creation of Dashboard and Adding Reports
Objective:
This section details the process of creating a dashboard in the Library Management System, which visually represents the data from the Active Members Report and the Available Books Report. The dashboard provides a comprehensive overview for library management and facilitates quick decision-making.

Steps to Create a Dashboard:
1. Navigate to the Dashboards Tab
Log in to your Salesforce Developer account.
Click on the App Launcher (grid icon) and select Dashboards.
2. Create a New Dashboard
Click on the New Dashboard button.
Enter a name for the dashboard, such as Library Management Dashboard.
Provide a brief description (e.g., “Dashboard showcasing active members and available books.”).
Choose the folder where you want to save the dashboard (e.g., Private Dashboards).
Click Create.
3. Add a Picture to the Dashboard
To enhance the visual appeal, click on the + Component button.
In the component type selection, choose Image.
Enter the image URL (ensure the image is hosted online) or upload an image directly if your Salesforce org allows it.
Adjust the size and position as needed, then click Add to insert the picture.
4. Add Active Members Report to the Dashboard
Click on the + Component button again to add another component.
In the component type selection, choose Report.
From the Select Report dialog, search for Active Members Report that you created earlier.
Choose the report and select a suitable display type (e.g., Table, Chart).
Configure any additional settings such as chart type, labels, etc.
Click Add to insert the report component into the dashboard.
5. Add Available Books Report to the Dashboard
Repeat the process by clicking on the + Component button.
Choose Report from the component type selection again.
Search for Available Books Report and select it.
Choose the display type that best suits the data visualization (e.g., Bar Chart, Pie Chart).
Configure any additional settings for this component.
Click Add to insert the available books report into the dashboard.
6. Save and Arrange the Dashboard Components
Once all components are added, you can drag and drop them to arrange their layout on the dashboard.
Click on the Save button to save your dashboard configuration.
7. View the Dashboard
Click on the Done button to exit the dashboard builder.
You will now see your Library Management Dashboard with all components displayed.
Ensure that the data from both reports is accurately represented.
